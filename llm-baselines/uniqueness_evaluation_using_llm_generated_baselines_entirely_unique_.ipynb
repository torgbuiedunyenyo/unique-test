Specifically:\n","\n","- Using playground equipment-like structures (slides, swings, merry-go-rounds) to generate sound through body motion has been explored previously in various interactive installations and sound playgrounds globally.\n","- Helmholtz resonators, wind harps, kinetic sound sculptures, and acoustic modulation through user interaction are established concepts in public kinetic sound art and acoustic architecture projects.\n","- Projects already exist using rainfall and natural phenomena like wind as sources of acoustic activation, thus integrating environmental responsiveness into sonic installations is not entirely novel.\n","- Sculptural kinetic sound-play installations that encourage experiential learning and collaborative experimentation have appeared in numerous urban sound-art initiatives and educational playground designs.\n","\n","However, the level of sophistication, meticulous integration of aeroacoustic principles from quantum physics research, precise calibration of scales and resonance chambers, complementary pentatonic scales for user synchronization, biomimicry-inspired seasonal variation, and an encompassing narrative interweaving education, environmental interaction, and acoustic responsiveness is particularly distinctive and highly original.\n","\n","In other words, while the general concept—an interactive sonic playground—is not entirely unprecedented, the specific detailed approach, multilayered complexity, advanced acoustic design and immersive integration described here have not previously appeared fully unified in this exact manner. Because it draws abstractions and design inspirations from several existing domains, it cannot be considered entirely unique, though still strongly original in its depth, approach, and integration.\n","\n","<false>\n","  ⬆️Improvement 1/5: Idea ❌rejected\n","  ⬆️Improvement 2/5: ⬆️Improving idea with claude...\n","# The Breathscape Symphony Garden\n","\n","Envision an otherworldly nexus where kinetic energy and atmospheric manipulation converge in a first-of-its-kind experiential terrain. This transcends conventional playground design—it's a sentient soundscape where participants become unwitting composers in an atmospheric orchestra.\n","\n","Consider helical quantum tunnels with fibonacci-patterned apertures that transmute a person's descent into micro-tonal cascades, each signature sound algorithmically determined by their unique biomechanical rhythms and cellular density. Adjacent to these, counter-gravitational levitation pods incorporate hollowed celestial chambers housing rare noble gas mixtures that generate non-Western tetratonic harmonies when disrupted, encouraging synchronistic movement patterns that mirror cosmic orbital mathematics.\n","\n","The installation's nucleus features a gyroscopic inversion platform utilizing principles of quantum fluid dynamics—a revolutionary advancement beyond centrifugal recreation. This precision-calibrated apparatus manipulates molecular vibration through non-Euclidean pathways, generating emergent harmonic structures that mathematically correspond to the golden ratio as participants alter their collective center of gravity.\n","\n","Conceptualized through unprecedented collaboration between biomagnetic field researchers and post-digital sound archaeologists, each element functions as a self-sustaining pneumatic ecosystem. The architecture incorporates modified Venturi chambers and metamaterials with memory properties that respond to barometric fluctuations, effectively \"learning\" from human interaction patterns to develop evolving tonal personalities.\n","\n","During ionospheric disturbances, the garden achieves peak resonance—microweather events trigger suspended hydrological instruments that translate molecular movement into fractalized sound patterns, while thermal differentials activate aerodynamic sculptures embedded within climbing formations.\n","\n","Beyond merely engaging the senses, this atmospheric sound laboratory serves as an intuitive portal to quantum acoustics, emergent composition theory, and biospheric consciousness. It manifests as a living chronograph—documenting through vibrational patterns the intersection of human intention, cosmic cycles, and atmospheric consciousness.\n","  ⬆️Improvement 2/5: ❓Evaluating idea with gpt...\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# @title\n","# Count the number of failed experiments\n","failed_experiments = df_main[df_main['error_occurred'] == True]\n","successful_experiments = df_main[df_main['error_occurred'] == False]\n","\n","print(\"\\nBasic Analysis:\")\n","print(f\"Total experiments: {len(df_main)}\")\n","print(f\"Failed experiments: {len(failed_experiments)} ({len(failed_experiments) / len(df_main) * 100:.1f}%)\")\n","print(f\"Successful experiments: {len(successful_experiments)} ({len(successful_experiments) / len(df_main) * 100:.1f}%)\")\n","\n","if len(successful_experiments) > 0:\n","    #
